# ODK-X Application Designer 

This project is __*actively maintained*__

The developer [wiki](https://github.com/odk-x/tool-suite-X/wiki) (including release notes) and [issues tracker](https://github.com/odk-x/tool-suite-X/issues) are located under the [**ODK-X Tool Suite**](https://github.com/odk-x) project.

This repository contains the ODK-X Application Designer software.

Complete Android apps, including data entry, synchronization, and distribution,
can be written using HTML and JavaScript files. ODK-X Tables and ODK-X Survey will
serve these files as the skin of your app.

Projects intending to write a Tables app can clone this repository and use it
as a starting point.

Much of the boilerplate of app creation can be avoided by employing the Grunt
tasks specified in the Gruntfile.
